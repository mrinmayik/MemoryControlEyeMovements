# Retrieval Control and Memory-based Eye Movements

This repository contains the code for the shiny app that summarises the results from our paper titled "Control of Memory Retrieval Alters Memory-Based Eye-Movements" (Kulkarni, Nickel, Minor, Hannula, 2023; [doi.org/10.1037/xlm0001321](doi.org/10.1037/xlm0001321)). This summary is meant for a non-scientific audience.
