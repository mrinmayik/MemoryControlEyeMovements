We also found that controlling memory for scene-tool pairs affected how well participants remembered them in a later memory test. This drop in memory accuracy for the suppressed and substituted pairs was worse even relative to trials that weren't presented during the memory control and search phase (the baseline pairs). This is interesting because it means that controlling a memory weakens it to a level over and above what we might expect from just passive forgetting (i.e., pairs that were forgotten because they weren't rehearsed). This suggests that the neural process by which we lose memories due to forgetting is different from the one by which we lose memories that the target of retrieval suppression, or thought substitution!"),

It is possible, then, that the brain treats faces differently from other objects, making it harder to modify memories for faces. Another possibility is that, because these were famous faces, participants had a lot of contextual information about them, even before they began the experiment (e.g., watching Barack Obama speak, watching Rupert Grint's movies, or enjoying Bruno Mars' music). Participants could have used this information to build stronger associations between the scenes and faces, making those memories more resistant to weakening.
